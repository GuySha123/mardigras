                            Gras is a
                            holiday,
                            just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of
                            businesses
                            who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the
                            term
                            “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not
                            know
                            better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each
                            individual
                            parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country,
                            official
                            organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                                The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the
                                Epiphany).
                                Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.
                                <br><br>

                                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each
                                year.
                                Fat Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.
                                <br><br>

                                Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay
                                through Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall
                                through
                                the next few years.

                                The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot.
                                Sometimes it
                                will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer
                                your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that
                                can
                                get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are
                                predicted,
                                then you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                                <strong>By all means, yes!</strong> Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a
                                family
                                celebration. Those
                                of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we
                                continue
                                going to every parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring
                                big
                                bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often
                                include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

                                The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size
                                parades
                                pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near
                                Napoleon since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden
                                District
                                portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out
                                their
                                parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the
                                beautiful
                                oak trees. You don't have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this
                                area
                                during Mardi Gras.
                                <br><br>

                                You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like
                                Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the
                                Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras
                                day.
