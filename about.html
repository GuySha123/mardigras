            <h2>Mardi Gras History </h2>

            <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th
                and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
                Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies. <br><br>

                On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot
                of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men
                realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane"
                (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated
                America's very first Mardi Gras.<br><br>

                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and
                paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels
                by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten
                meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.<br><br>

                New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
                Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis
                de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras
                balls of today.<br><br>

                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
                hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.<br><br>

                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
                celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and
                lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the
                Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought
                magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe
                members remained anonymous.</p>

            <p>In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first
                recorded account of Mardi Gras "throws."<br><br>

                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
                lithographs of parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats
                were always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and
                details could not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other
                Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the
                float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these
                designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who
                for 40 years was responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.<br><br>

                1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the
                first daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen
                introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple
                stands for justice; gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that
                Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the Duke's
                fondness for the tune.<br><br>

                The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France,
                culminating with Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which
                exotic paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and
                local officials, including Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras
                Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.<br><br>

                Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private
                social clubs with restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are
                completely funded by their members, New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>
